This is the C-code that implements the MaxPhase algorithm. The codes are documented using Doxygen. The 'Doxyfile' is provided as part of the distribution, so run 'doxygen' to generate the documentation. 
(A global overview of the codes and examples will be provided in a User manual that is under development.)
