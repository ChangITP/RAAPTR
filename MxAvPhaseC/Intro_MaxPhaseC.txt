\mainpage Introduction
The MaxPhase algorithm, described in [WMJ2], implements
the Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT) and Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)
for gravitational wave searches from isolated continuous wave sources 
using Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) data. 

This documentation describes the C implementation of MaxPhase. The following external libraries are required: 
[GNU Scientific Library](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/), 
[MPICH] (https://www.mpich.org), and the Matlab [MAT file API](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/read-and-write-matlab-mat-files-in-c-c-and-fortran.html). (The 
MAT file format is used for storing input and output data.)

\section Install Installation
Installation of the code can be done by replacing path names appropriately in the supplied makefile. Basically, 
the proper paths to the include files and the libraries mentioned above need to be set. Once the makefile has been edited, do 'make' to compile the codes.

\section use Usage
A user manual has been provided separately.
